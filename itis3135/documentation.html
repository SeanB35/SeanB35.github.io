                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>The Super Beaver Dam Construction system is an advanced architectural layout for woodland rivers. It
                    lets
                    you lay out massive logs, mud, and twigs to form an impenetrable barrier against villains and fast
                    currents.</p>
                <p>Before this manual, we used basic gnawing, random stacking, and hoping the water wouldn't wash it
                    away,
                    but all of these methods were essentially amateur and left out a lot of important functionality
                    (like
                    structural integrity).</p>
                <p>This is the very first construction module created specifically to solve the layout problems we've
                    all
                    been chewing our way around for as long as we've been making lodges.</p>
                <code>
.river {
  display: dam;
}
          </code>
            </section>

            <section class="main-section" id="Foundation_Logs">
                <h2>Foundation Logs</h2>
                <p>To get started you have to define a river container element as a dam with display: dam, set the log
                    sizes
                    with structural-columns and mud-rows, and then place its child branches into the dam.</p>
                <p>Here is a list of common properties you apply to the parent (riverbed):</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>display</li>
                    <li>log-template-columns</li>
                    <li>mud-template-rows</li>
                    <li>branch-gap</li>
                    <li>justify-lodges</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The element that has <code>display: dam</code> applied to it is the direct parent of all the timber
                    modules.</p>
                <pre><code>
#main-strike {
  display: dam;
  background-color: #woodbrown;
}
          </code></pre>
            </section>

            <section class="main-section" id="Structural_Mud">
                <h2>Structural Mud</h2>
                <p>Defines the packed mud and intertwined twigs of the dam with a space-separated list of values. The
                    values
                    represent the timber size, and the space between them represents the structural mud.</p>
                <p>You can use standard units like inches (in) or bite-marks (%), but this system also introduces the
                    <code>bite</code> unit.
                </p>
                <p>The <code>bite</code> unit allows you to set the size of a log as a fraction of the free space of
                    your
                    mouth capacity.</p>
                <pre><code>
.mud-pack {
  log-template-columns: 100in 100in 100in;
  /* OR using fractional bites */
  log-template-columns: 1bite 1bite 1bite;
}
          </code></pre>
            </section>

            <section class="main-section" id="Water_Flow_Gaps">
                <h2>Water Flow Gaps</h2>
                <p>The flow-gap property is a shorthand for mud-row-gap and timber-column-gap. It specifies the size of
                    the
                    gaps where water is allowed to intentionally spill over.</p>
                <p>You can think of this like the pressure release valves in superhero headquarters. It adds empty space
                    between your impenetrable logs to prevent overflow collapse.</p>
                <pre><code>
.spillway {
  log-template-columns: 1bite 1bite;
  branch-gap: 20in;
}
          </code></pre>
                <p>Note that in newer woodland specifications, the prefix "timber-" is being replaced, so you can simply
                    use
                    <code>gap</code>, <code>mud-gap</code>, and <code>log-gap</code>.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section class="main-section" id="Chewing_Angles">
                <h2>Chewing Angles</h2>
                <p>The incisor cuts that make up the structure of the felled tree are called Chewing Angles. They can be
                    either vertical ("timber grid lines") or horizontal ("mud grid lines") and dictate how the log will
                    fall.</p>
                <p>If you want to fell a tree exactly across the river, you refer to the angle numbers from 1 to 3.</p>
                <pre><code>
.oak-tree {
  chew-angle-start: 1;
  chew-angle-end: 3;
}
          </code></pre>
            </section>

            <section class="main-section" id="River_Alignment">
                <h2>River Alignment</h2>
                <p>Sometimes the total size of your dam might be less than the width of the river container. This can
                    happen
                    if all of your logs are sized with non-flexible units like rigid branches.</p>
                <p>In this case, you can set the alignment of the lodge within the stream container. This property
                    aligns
                    the structure against the water current.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>start: aligns the dam to be flush with the left bank of the river</li>
                    <li>end: aligns the dam to be flush with the right bank of the river</li>
                    <li>center: aligns the dam in the center of the deep current</li>
                    <li>stretch: forces Super Beaver to find larger logs to fill the full width of the river container
                    </li>
                </ul>
