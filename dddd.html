    <h1>Walkthrough</h1>
    <p>This came out of a 24-hour work sprint to replicate some sophisticated video VFX in to make it more flexible. <a href="https://www.tesla.cn/design-leader">You can see the original here</a></p>
    <p>There's a lot of pieces that go into an effect like this. What follows is an outline of the animations and VFX concepts, all in pure css :)</p>
    <p>Core principles:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Keep the text legible most of the time</li>
      <li>Don't throw too many glitches in per second. Give it space to breathe</li>
      <li>Whitespace never hurt anyone</li>
      <li>Blurs & glows lend a feeling of realism in dark environments (queue neon)</li>
    </ol>
  </section>
  
  <section>
    <h2>layers</h2>
    <p>Create muultiple layers to play with. For this example I'll use ::before & ::after elements, but this could just as easily be multiple divs overlapped, or whatever.</p>
    <h2 class="hero layers" data-text="EXAMPLE">EXAMPLE</h2>
  </section>
  
  <section>
    <h2>Paths</h2>
    <p>Build out a set of clip-paths (Eg. I wrote up a <a href="https://codepen.io/mattgrosswork/pen/bGgWGxy">generator util</a> for this project)</p>
    <p>Example Path:</p>
    <div class="demo single-path"></div>
    <p>Over text:</p>
    <h2 class="hero paths">EXAMPLE</h2>
  </section>
  
  <section>
    <h2>Movement</h2>
    <p>Create a stepping movement animation, so that the layers above can appear in different places as the other layers of the animation happen.</p>
    <p>It's best to make this timing somewhat erratic.</p>
    <div class="demo movement"></div>
  </section>
  
  <section>
    <h2>Opacity</h2>
    <p>Create a similar animation for opacity, so that the layers can appear/disappear. This will get layered with the movement to create the appearance of the layers popping in and out in different places</p>
    <p>There's an art to getting this transition to work without making the user feel motion sickness. Take some time getting it right</p>
    <div class="demo opacity"></div>
  </section>
  
  <section>
    <h2>Font</h2>
    <p>The next layer is changes to the font directly. These could be any properties, but we'll stick to font-weight and color.</p>
    <h2 class="hero font">EXAMPLE</h2>
  </section>
  
  <section>
    <h2>Combined Animation Layers</h2>
    <p>Note that some of tthe animations have sync'd timing, and some don't.</p>
    <p>I try to sync the paths & opacity animations, so that it looks like the background layers are really a part of the main text that's glitching off.</p>
    <p>Then I try to separately sync the color/text/filter other effects, and keep the moevment separate completely. This gives the whole thing the appearance of a lot more effects than are actually happening, because of the different combinations.</p>
    <h2 class="hero glitch layers" data-text="EXAMPLE">
      <span>EXAMPLE</span>
    </h2>
  </section>
  
  <section>
    <h2>Environment</h2>
    <p>For good measure, it should live in the right language & context :)</p>
  
    <div class="hero-container">
      <div class="environment"></div>
      <h2 class="hero glitch layers" data-text="近設計"><span>近設計</span></h2>
